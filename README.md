# Advanced programming

- these solutions deserve some attention:
  - first lab [bonus](./lab1/bonus.java) and [results](./lab1/bonus%20result.txt)
    - nice backtracking solution
  - second lab [bonus](./lab2/Bonus.java) and [results](./lab2/bonus%20result.txt)
    - the random generation of data is based on seeds
      - allowing to develop interesting random properties
      - creating balanced random results
      - proving my mathematical abilities and planning skills
    - greedy solution
    - backtrack solution
    - Hopcroft-Karp solution
      - used because of its efficiency - time complexity: O(sqrt(V)*E)
      - fully documented but not entirely implemented

- to run the experiment: make sure to run this first `cd experiment/`
  - important: the development of critical thinking
  - context: some time-comparison results from the course that seemed suspicious

- `algo` directory is meant to hold some personal solutions and algorithms
- `docs` directory is meant to hold the javadoc files for the second lab
- each laboratory contains:
  - the compulsory task
  - the homework
  - the bonus activity
  - the task
